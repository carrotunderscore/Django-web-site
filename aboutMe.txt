My name is Robert Gustafsson and I'm a programmer from Sweden. I have about 5 years as a programmer and I discovered it from the movie The Social Network. Watching Mark Zuckerberg casually hacking Harvards social networks while drinking beer looked so cool to me as a teenager. This isn't really what programming is but back then I was unaware of that.

In October 2023 I started climbing with my long term girlfriend and fell in love with it. I love how cerebral and social climbing is. It feels like programming in athletic form. Maybe it's just me connecting everything I know with programming...

I'm on the autistic spectrum which is probably why I'm so comfortable with tech. I love the structure of technology and how it works. I know that if something is not making sense I'll just try different sources and eventually it will click. This is how I approach learning in general. Because of programming, I feel that I can learn anything. Learning problem solving has helped med with everything in my life and I'm so ever grateful for discovering programming.
