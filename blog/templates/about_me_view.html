                  My name is Robert Gustafsson and I'm a programmer from Sweden. I have about 5 years as a programmer
                  and I discovered it from the movie The Social Network. Watching Mark Zuckerberg casually hacking Harvards social networks while
                  drinking beer looked so cool to me as a teenager. This isn't really what programming is but back then I was unaware of that.
                  <br><br>
                  In October 2023 I started climbing with my long term girlfriend and fell in love with it. I love how cerebral and social climbing is.
                  It feels like programming in athletic form. Maybe it's just me connecting everything I know with programming...
                  <br><br>
                  I'm on the autistic spectrum which is probably why I'm so comfortable with tech. I love the structure of technology and how it works.
                  I know that if something is not making sense I'll just try different sources and eventually it will click.
                  This is how I approach learning in general. Because of programming, I feel that I can learn anything.
                  Learning problem solving has helped med with everything in my life and I'm so ever grateful for discovering programming.
